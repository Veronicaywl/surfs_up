### Key Difference
- The temperature records of June tends to be stability then the records of December. 
- Compare to the both maximum and minimum temperatures in June. The difference are 21 degrees. The temperatures are relatively stable. The maximum is 85 degree and the minmum is 64 degree. 
- Compare to the both maximum and minimum temperatures in December. The difference are 27 degrees. The temperatures are unstable compare to June. The lowest temperature is 56 degree. 

## Summary
 To summize, even though the temperautures in December is not stablized as the month of June. December is still appropriate weather for both surfing and selling ice cream. The difference of average temperatures in June and December only 4 degrees. Therefore, I think the decision to open surfing and selling ice cream is appropriate. The alternative is to close the business earlier during December.
